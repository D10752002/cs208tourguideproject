\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
In our modern world almost everything is available on our fingertips. Entertainment, work or recreation all of which are easily accessible. One of the few areas however that lags behind in development due to the sheer variety in destinations is travel. In our age most people before going on vacation, plan their trip sitting on an armchair. When to reach which place, how to reach that place, how long to stay and so on… . However where as the information about hotels and transportation is well organized, the information about the various places/monuments/resorts itself is not well documented. To get information about each of them we have to rely on government websites, which is a tedious job. Even if there are private websites they usually advertise limited information, limited to only the services the provide at the location. So what our web app does is it displays all relevant information about the place at a single place. This information includes links to various hotel booking apps, a link to IRCTC for booking trains, phone numbers and information about tour guides etc.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This SRS can be useful for developers, project managers, users and testers. The document will provide in detail the working of our Site 'Tour Buddy' .

\section{Project Scope}
Our website creates a specific webpage for each place and takes in reviews from the customers and adds them to it. Our project singlehandedly covers the job of providing detail analysis of various destinations and how to reach them, where to stay and whom to take as a tour guide. There our other miscellaneous features such as tour buddy in which if a particular place is far from urban areas you can choose a travel companion so as to reduce the taxi fare. There is also the nearest atm feature which helps in finding ATMs nearest to you. The app also has nearest restaurant feature. All in all the project decreases the burden on the tourist by not making him surf a lot of websites to get information and thus helps in convenience of travel.

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
The software quality attributes are explained in detail below:\newline
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Efficiency}: The system will be implemented using MongoDB database and coded in a highly structured manner using \textbf{Flask}, \textbf{jQuery} along with \textbf{MongoDB} database, since the software is aimed to be hosted in a website, it won’t be wasting any memory or processing cycles of the user’s devices.\newline

\item \textbf{Maintainability}: Since the system is implemented in HTML, CSS, JS, and Flask, all the files are \textit{highly ordered and easily read by any developers} in the future and can easily pick out a particular feature to modify, since the frontend and backend of the system are separated it shall be easy for the system to evolve as per the customer’s needs and changing requirements. It is very easy to implement this as it also ensures to minimize the costs required to change the software as the new updates need not be manually installed in each user’s device.\newline
\item \textbf{Dependability}: Since the system uses the highly reliable \textit{cloud software MongoDB}, all the user’s personal or confidential information is stored securely and proper fail-safes shall be enforced to secure the database in any event of a crash of the software, thus making sure it won’t cause any physical or economical harm to both the users and the developers. MongoDB ensures high security, by ensuring proper \textit{encryption} and even \textit{IP access listing} to make sure the database is only accessed by the admin, and once connected to the cluster, the developers do not need to physically access the data to make changes.\newline
\item \textbf{In time}: Proper work division and teamwork can assure the software is developed with a properly working implementation of all features within the intended time\newline
\item \textbf{Functionality}: The system shall perform all the necessary tasks required by a user intending to access the services of a proper tour guide, by the automation of several features, the system offers easy access to resources for the user to properly plan the intended tour, minimizes the budget of the user, offers several alternatives and suggestions based on reviews, also has several features to access all the necessary facilities to \textit{facilitate safe and secure travel}.\newline
\item \textbf{Adaptability}: The system is \textit{easily maintainable} and due to the highly ordered implementation of the software it is \textit{very easy to access} and change only the necessary files even in the absence of the original developers in case of a change in requirements of the software.\newline
\item \textbf{Acceptability}: The system shall be \textit{user-friendly}, and designed after intensive discussion of all features, and ease of operating the software. The system is also \textit{highly compatible} and does not require any modification of the user’s current software in their devices. All the features are properly described so that any user even without prior knowledge of the working of the system can easily understand and use the system’s features to access resources.\newline
\item \textbf{Portability}: The system is \textit{highly portable} since it can easily be modified into a different language, the database handling, backend design, frontend design is implemented in different files and folders it is easy for any developer to access certain files and convert them into a different language and use the rest of the design with minimal modifications.\newline
\item \textbf{Scalability}: The system shall be implemented with a good base and core functionalities, and shall easily adapt as per the user’s demands.\newline
\item \textbf{Understandability}: The system is easily understandable by the users and developers alike, the developers can pick out the necessary parts of the program and modify it with ease if required.\newline
\item \textbf{Testability}: Since the system is designed in a highly ordered fashion, it is\textit{ easy to} find or \textit{isolate any bugs or faults} of the system in a particular part of the software and modify only those files without disturbing the rest of the program.
